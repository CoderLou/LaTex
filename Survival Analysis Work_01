         \section*{1. Problem 2.2, Page 17}
We are given a life table for the total population of 100,000 live births in the United States from 1959 to 1961. \\

The computation of the estimated survivorship function S(t), the probability density function f(t), and the hazard function h(t) of this data can be seen below:

Note: $l_t$ here refers to the total number of living people beginning at the interval of time, while $d_t$ refers to the number dying in the corresponding time interval. \\

From these computations we can then plot the functions in order to better visualize the trends in the data:

    \section*{2. Problem 2.3, Page 17}
We are given:
\begin{equation}\tag{2.2.1}
    h(t) = \frac{f(t)}{S(t)}
\end{equation}
We are to show how it can be derived from:
\begin{equation}\tag{2.1.6}
    	h(t) = \lim_{\Delta t\to0} \frac{\text{an individual fails in the time interval} (t,t+\Delta t) \text{given the individual has survived to t}}{\Delta t} 
\end{equation}
by using the basic definitions of conditional probability.

Furthermore, we will begin by expressing (2.1.6) in terms of conditional probablity:
\begin{equation}
h(t) =  \lim_{\Delta t\to0} \frac{P(t < T < t +\Delta t | T > t)}{\Delta t}=\lim_{\Delta t\to0} \frac{P(t < T < t +\Delta t)}{\Delta t P(T>t)}
\end{equation}
Next we express f(t) and S(t) by their definitions in terms of conditional probablity:
\begin{equation}
f(t) =  \lim_{\Delta t\to0} \frac{P(t < T < t +\Delta t)}{\Delta t} 
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
S(t) =  P(T>t)
\end{equation}



Refering back to (1), we can rewrite the equation as:
\begin{equation}
h(t) = \lim_{\Delta t\to0} \frac{P(t < T < t +\Delta t)}{\Delta t P(T>t)}=f(t) \frac{1}{S(t)}=\frac{f(t)}{S(t)}
\end{equation}
Therefore we can clearly see that the hazard function defined in terms of a ratio of the probablity density function and the survivor function (2.2.1) can be derived from the definition given to it in (2.1.6). QED


            \section*{3. Problem 2.5, Page 18}
We are given the following survivorship function: 
\begin{equation*}
    S(t) = exp(-t^y)
\end{equation*}

(i.) The probability density function f(t) can be obtained by first using the following relationship between the survivorship function and the cumulative density function F(t):
\begin{equation*}
    S(t) = 1-F(t) \equiv F(t) = 1-S(t)
\end{equation*}
As f(t) would be the derivative of F(t) here, we can simply rewrite this relationship as:
\begin{equation*}
    f(t)= \frac{d(1-S(t))}{d(t)} = \frac{-dS(t)}{d(t)} = \frac{-d(exp(-t^y))}{d(t)}=-yt^{y-1}exp(-t^y)
\end{equation*}
Therefore the pdf here would be $f(t) = -yt^{y-1}exp(-t^y)$. \\

(ii.) We can similarly obtain the hazard function h(t) with another simple relationship:
\begin{equation*}
    h(t) = \frac{f(t)}{S(t)} = \frac{-yt^{y-1}exp(-t^y)}{exp(-t^y)} = -yt^{y-1}
\end{equation*}

Thus the hazard function is clearly $h(t) = -yt^{y-1}$ . \\

(iii.) Finally, the cumulative hazard function H(t) we obtain by using the direct relationship:
\begin{equation*}
    H(t) = -ln[S(t)]=-ln[exp(-t^y)] = -(-t^y)=t^y
\end{equation*}
The cummulative hazard function may be expressed as $H(t) = t^y$.

            \section*{5. Gompertz Distribution}
Consider the Gompertz distribution with survival function given by 
\begin{equation*}
    S(t) = exp[-\frac{e^\lambda}{\gamma}(e^{\gamma t}-1)]
\end{equation*}
We are interested in finding the hazard function h(t), which we can do by using the following relationship: 
\begin{equation*}
    h(t) = \frac{f(t)}{S(t)}
\end{equation*}
Where f(t) is the probability density function (pdf) of the Gompertz distribution: 
\begin{equation*}
   f(t) = \theta e^{\alpha t}exp[\frac{\theta}{\alpha}(1-e^{\alpha t})]
\end{equation*}
By letting $\theta = e^{\lambda}, \alpha = \gamma: $

\begin{equation*}
     h(t)=\frac{f(t)}{S(t)}=\frac{e^{\lambda} e^{\gamma t}exp[\frac{e^\lambda}{\gamma}(1-e^{\gamma t})]}{exp[\frac{e^\lambda}{\gamma}(1-e^{\gamma t})]}=e^{\lambda} e^{\gamma t}=exp[\lambda + \gamma t]
\end{equation*}

Therefore our hazard function here would clearly be \textbf {h(t) = exp[\lambda + \gamma t]}



            \section*{6. Poisson random variable}
Let X be a Poisson random variable with pmf:
\begin{equation*}
    p(x)=e^{-\lambda}\frac{\lambda^x}{x!},  x=0,1,...
\end{equation*}
In showing that the hazard function is monotone increasing we begin with the relationship:

\begin{equation}
    h(t_j) = P(T=t_j | T \geq t_j) = \frac{p(t_j)}{S(t_j)}=\frac{p(t_j)}{1-F(j)}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    F(j)=P(x \leq j) = \sum_{i=0}^je^{-\lambda}\frac{\lambda^i}{i!}
\end{equation}
From (1):
\begin{equation}
    h(j) = \frac{e^{-\lambda}\frac{\lambda^j}{j!}}{ \sum_{i=0}^j e^{-\lambda}\frac{\lambda^i}{i!}}=\frac{\lambda^j}{j!\sum_{i=0}^j \frac{\lambda^i}{i!}}
\end{equation}
Moreover:
\begin{equation}
    h(j+1)-h(j) \equiv \frac{\lambda^{j+1}}{(j+1)!\sum_{i=0}^{j+1} \frac{\lambda^i}{i!}} - \frac{\lambda^j}{j!\sum_{i=0}^j \frac{\lambda^i}{i!}}=\frac{\lambda^j}{j!\sum_{i=0}^j \frac{\lambda^i}{i!}}[\frac{\lambda}{(j+1)\frac{\lambda^{j+1}}{(j+1)!}}-1]
\end{equation}

$h(j+1)-h(j)$ can ultimately be expressed as:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{j!-\lambda^j}{j! \sum_{i=0}^j \frac{\lambda^i}{i!}} > 0
\end{equation}

Therefore: $h(j+1) \geq h(j) \forall$ j; the hazard function is monotone increasing. QED

\section*{Extra Credit}
 Consider a continuous lifetime distribution with survival function S(t), hazard functionh(t), cumulative hazard function H(t), and mean residual life function m(t). Consider the
following properties: (a) h(t) is nondecreasing for t ≥ 0. Distributions with this property
are often said to have the increasing failure rate (IFR) property. (b) m(t) is a decreasing
function for t ≥ 0. This is called the decreasing mean residual life property. (c) m(t) ≤ m(0)
for all t ≥ 0. Distributions with this property are often said to have the ”new better than
used” property. Show that (a) ⇒ (b) ⇒ (c).
